      <p>My name, as you've read, is Destinee Miles. I was born and raised south of Chicago where i grew up and developed an interest in puzzles and solving. I enjoy real world interactions as a person, but there is so much life in the technical world. 
      Being a developer brings so many questions i cant wait to answer and keep answering.</p>
